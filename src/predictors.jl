### Cosine distance predictor
"""
This function makes predictions for the given encodings by finding the closest class encoding in terms of cosine distance.\n
Input: 
    - a vector of encoded test sequences.\n
    - a dictionary of encoded reference sequences with their class a key.\n
Output: a vector of class predictions in the same order as the input test encodings.\n
    
DISCLAIMER: Currently every test encoding given to this function will be classified to the closest class, even when the true class is not in the train encodings.
